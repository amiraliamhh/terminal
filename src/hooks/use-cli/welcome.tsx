    Hello! I'm Amirali. Welcome to my personal website!
    <br />
    If you are here to learn more about me, you can just type "resume" and press "Enter".
    <br />
    You will be navigated to an online version of my resume. Also, if you just want to see a PDF version of it,
    <br />
    type "resume --pdf" and then, again, press "Enter".
    <br />
    Also, you are more than welcome to learn more about me using this terminal!
    <br />
    You can start by typing "whoami", or you can
    just type "help" to get a list of all of the available commands.
